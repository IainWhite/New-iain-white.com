Iain White JavaScript Guru	

I am a experienced and talented front-end developer.
I first started developing in JavaScript in 1999 while working at Reuters.
I was fascinated by having to script cross-browser for Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.
This lead to me becoming a Web Developer and I have been crafting HTML, CSS and JavaScript solutions for the past <?php echo $this->stencil->elapsedYears('01/01/1999'); ?>.
I have developed my own cross-browser JavaScript libraries and have worked with Ext, MooTools, Prototype and script.aculo.us but now mostly use jQuery.
I have done a lot of work with third party APIs including Google Maps and Google Visualisation.
I have developed Single Page Applications(SPA) and utilised AJAXwhere appropriate.
I am passionate about front-end development and have staid myself up to date with AngularJS, Ember etc.
I have have piratical experience developing with HTML5, CSS-3, Foundation Framework and Bootstrap.
Although not a Web Designer I have basic image processing skill using Photoshop.
