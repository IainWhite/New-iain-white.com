Scrum Master

I have been a Certified Scrum Master since November 2013.

I am an experienced full stack Web Developer with Agile Team Leader experience with a deep understanding of the Software Development process.

While my background and first love was in Software Engineering, I have found my niche managing projects and people in an Agile environment, while maintaining a very much hands on approach with the software codebase.

My speciality is developing innovative cross technology solutions while staying focused on the needs of the end customer and the business. I have also had success with growing the capabilities of multi skilled teams to deliver complex web based applications that perform as required in a timely manner with happy and informed Product Owners and Stakeholders.

I am an accomplished and fluent communicator and a certified Scrum Master with strong investigation, problem-solving and decision-making skills, combined with a pragmatic approach and sound business acumen.

I have worked in both small and large companies and a variety of industries including manufacture, ISP, health, travel, news and marketing.
