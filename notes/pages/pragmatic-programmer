Iain White Pragmatic Programmer

I am a big fan of the book The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.
When I first read this book I saw a reflection of my few on Software Development and I always have a copy close and recommended it to team mates and managers.
I often find myself quoting principles such as DRY and No Broken Windows.
I regard myself as a Pragmatic Programmer.


DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
This will increase your maintenance capabilities and lower bugs proliferation.

No Broken Windows

The concept of Broken Windows come from the criminological theory:
Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it’s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters.
In software development, broken windows are bad designs, wrong decisions or even poor code. If you don’t fix them as you find them, you’ll end up quickly with software rot.
