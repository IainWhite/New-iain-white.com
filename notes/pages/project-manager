Iain White Project Manager

I have successfully managed the scoping, planning, deployment and delivery of projects in time and to budget.
While my background and first love was in Software Engineering, I have found my niche managing projects and people in an Agile environment.
I am an accomplished and fluent communicator and a certified Scrum Master with strong investigation, problem-solving and decision-making skills, combined with a pragmatic approach and sound business acumen.
I have worked in both small and large companies and a variety of industries including manufacture, ISP, health, travel, news and marketing.
I have been a Certified Scrum Master since November 2013.
