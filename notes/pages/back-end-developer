Iain White Back-End Developer
=============================

A back-end developer is a type of programmer who creates the logical back-end and core computational logic of a website, software or information system.

I am a strong back-end developer.  I have been creating PHP, ASP, JSP, Python and Perl solutions since XXXX.

I am experienced in a variety of frameworks and Content Management Systems (CMS).

I have worked with a variety of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

I have also had experience working with NoSQL, including MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, MS Cosmos DB and Couchbase 

For most of my early carrier I would have described myself as a back-end developer, but I have always also developed for the front-end, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I now refer to myself as a Full Stack Developer, which is a better description of my skillset.
